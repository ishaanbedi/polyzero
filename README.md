## About PolyZero

PolyZero is a web-app created to help consumers estimate the single-use plastics they consume in a year plus the CO2 footprint emitted from those plastics. 
The goal of our app is to raise awareness and provide advice and tools for reducing your plastic footprint. Beyond that, we provide a simple mechanism to purchase CO2 off-sets in order to reduce the climate impact of the plastics that consumers are unable to eliminate from their lives.
